ðŸ©º Multiple Disease Prediction System
This project is an end-to-end machine learning application designed to predict the likelihood of multiple diseases based on user input. The system provides early risk assessment to aid in proactive health management.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:
Multi-Disease Prediction: Supports predictions for several diseases, including:

Diabetes

Heart Disease

Parkinsonâ€™s Disease

Machine Learning Models: Developed and trained separate models tailored for each disease using classification algorithms to ensure high prediction accuracy.

Data Processing Pipeline:

Cleaned and preprocessed datasets specific to each disease.

Applied feature scaling and encoding to optimize model performance.

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand correlations and patterns.

Model Evaluation: Assessed models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable predictions.

User Interface: Built an interactive Streamlit web application to allow users to input relevant medical parameters and instantly receive risk assessments for all supported diseases.

Deployment: Deployed the application for accessible, real-time use in web browsers.

ðŸ§  Technologies Used:
Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas, NumPy

Streamlit

Matplotlib, Seaborn

This project demonstrates the integration of machine learning models with a clean, intuitive interface to create a practical healthcare application that can support early disease detection and encourage timely medical consultation.
